Forked from krbaker (thank you!) - this is a super simple script that logs datetime, temp of grill, and temp of probe to the console in CSV format.

Assumes a config.json file to be located in the same directory as the python file with format:
`{"username": "<your email>", "password": "<your password>"}`
